# Quick Start

This short guide should help you get set up maintaining your own Gram deployment.

## Setting up the repository

The ideal setup is currently to clone the repository locally and push it to your own source control management system.

Create a bare clone of the repository and mirror-push to the new repository.

```sh
git clone --bare git@github.com:klarna-incubator/gram.git
cd gram.git
git push --mirror <your private repo>
```

Remove the temporary local repository you created earlier.

```sh
cd ..
rm -rf gram.git
```

Clone your own private repository and add Klarna upstream to pull updates from (more details later).

```sh
git clone <your private repo>
git remote add github https://github.com/klarna-incubator/gram.git
```

## First local run

With the repository cloned, run `npm install` to install dependencies and to set up
the workspace.

```sh
npm install
```

Next you need to start up the local database containers.

```sh
docker compose up -d
```

Then build and try to run the project

```sh
npm run dev # note: you'll need to restart this process if you make backend changes
```

## First Login

With the default configuration, Gram will be configured to use login via email.

For your first login, use the email address `admin@localhost`.

Since SMTP is not configured yet, you will need to get the actual link from your application logs:

```
[2023-11-07T14:29:12.229] [DEBUG] MagicLinkIdentityProvider - Sending magic link to <REDACTED> with link http://localhost:4726/login/callback/magic-link?token=<REDACTED>
```

For the default configuration, the login is limited to three hardcoded users: `user@localhost`, `reviewer@localhost` and `admin@localhost`.
You will need to change the configuration to change this.

## Modify the configuration

The `config/` package contains the configuration of your Gram application. This is where
you add custom plugins and functionality.

Check the `config/default.ts` for the base configuration. `config/[development|staging|production].ts` contains configuration for the different deployment environments which overload the default config. The `NODE_ENV` environment variable determines which of these is loaded at runtime.

The default setup comes with a minimal configuration which you'll likely want to change for a real deployment.
It uses static providers to feed sample data into Gram, regarding things like Systems, Teams, Users and Roles.

### Plugins

To install a new plugin into your config:

```
npm -w config i @gram/<pluginname>
```

Then adjust the configuration code as needed to load the new functionality.

## Deploying

Gram is designed to run as a single docker container with a Postgres database provided beside it. Typically, the Postgres database would be hosted on something like AWS RDS.

### Docker Compose Example

The [docker-compose.demo.yml](docker-compose.demo.yml) is a simple way you could run this application
in a production environment using just docker compose.

Ensure you set your environment variables before deployment.

```yml
environment:
  ORIGIN: http://localhost:4726 # (or your domain)
  POSTGRES_HOST: database
  POSTGRES_USER: gram
  POSTGRES_PASSWORD: somethingsecret
  POSTGRES_DATABASE: gram
  POSTGRES_DISABLE_SSL: "true"
  POSTGRES_PORT: 5432
  NODE_ENV: staging # i.e. prod/staging for non-demo purposes
  AUTH_SECRET: <some long secret used to sign auth tokens>
  EMAIL_HOST: ""
  EMAIL_PORT: ""
  EMAIL_PASSWORD: ""
  EMAIL_USER: ""
```

Run the demo via

```sh
docker-compose -f docker-compose.demo.yml up --build
```

To run this on a server, you can either build the image on the server or use a CI/CD pipeline to build the image.

### Warnings ⚠️

- There are some scalability issues to be aware of - currently we only run this as a single container as the WebSocket server used for the
  real-time diagram sharing only runs on the same express server. For Klarna's setup this has worked fine since we don't have that many concurrent users,
  but it will eventually hit a bottleneck and means the application can't be scaled horizontally. This is solvable but it's not anything we're prioritizing until it actually becomes a problem.

- This webapp was built with the premise that it would run on an internal-only, closed network and be accessible to all engineers. It will not withstand DoS or necessarily guarantee confidentiality if exposed
  directly on the internet.

## Pulling updates

The main Gram codebase runs on a single `main` branch as a "trunk" and
uses tag releases. The main branch should not necessarily be seen as stable, instead
we recommend pulling in the versioned tags:

```sh
git pull github v4.4.0 # recommended
# git pull github main # not recommended
```

After pulling new updates, you may need to re-run `npm install` to get the latest packages.
